### CUSTOM! GExpertsBPL - custom GExperts based on gexperts-r4314-trunk.

A playground. The changes are properly described in the commit messages.

---
### Summary:

- Empty GExperts, only the framework (and one expert), build as BPL package.

    You can rebuild and see your changes immediately without restarting RAD Studio.

    Some initializations and dependencies were resolved.

    There minor changes in GExpertsDebugWindow.

---

### Ideas:

- Merge 'IDE Menu Shortcuts' and 'Keyboard Shortcuts'. Plus information for Delphi default Key mappings.


- Reorder Experts - move up/down and sync with the menu items


- Uses Clause Manager / Project Dependencies

    Show units initialization order. Show it only for units with 'initialization/finalization' section.

    Pascal parser thread - Scope to project files only, On/Off switch, warning before first start.

    Project Dependencies - filter units in the project, find and highlight circular references.


- Integration of RAD Studio and IntelliJ.

    I use IntelliJ as a git client and I have to switch often between both applications.
