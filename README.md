### CUSTOM! GExpertsBPL - custom GExperts based on gexperts-r4314-trunk.

A playground. The changes are properly described in the commit messages.

---
### Summary:

- Empty GExperts, only the framework, build as BPL package.

    You can rebuild and see your changes immediately without restarting RAD Studio.

    Some initializations and dependencies were resolved.

    There minor changes in GExpertsDebugWindow.

---

### Ideas:

- Merge 'IDE Menu Shortcuts' and 'Keyboard Shortcuts', plus Delphi Key mappings.


- Units initialization order and circular references.

    Pascal parser thread - Scope to project files only, On/Off switch, warning before first start.


- Integration of RAD Studio and IntelliJ.

    I use IntelliJ as a git client and I have to switch often between both applications.
